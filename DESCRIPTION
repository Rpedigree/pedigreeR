Description: Tools to sort pedigrees and to extract the inbreeding coefficients
    and the relationship matrix. The use of pedigree data is central to genetics
    research within the animal and plant breeding comunities to predict 
    breeding values (e.g. Henderson, 1976) <doi:10.2307/2529339>. The relationship
    matrix between the individuals can be derived from pedigree structure following
    the algorithms described for example in Mrode (2004) <doi:10.1079/9780851990002.0000>.
    The core of the computational algorithms is implemented in C and the relationship matrix
    is stored as a sparse matrix using using the Matrix package.
